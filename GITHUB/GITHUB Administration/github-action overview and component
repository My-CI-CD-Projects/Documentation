* github & gitlab ci are platform oriented solutions.
if we have a plan to migrate to a different platform (like cloud) it is not the right solution to choose github or gitlab.
we can use github action as a CICD tool ,like jenkins.

In there, we write a .yaml file inside .github/.workflow .
In that .yaml ,we use different commands.

name:
on: [push]
-----------> whenever there is a push or commit in the repository by default the pipeline is executed.

we can use n number of yaml files in .github/.workflow folder.




jobs:  ------------------->even in one yaml file we can write multiple jobs(multiple pipelines)
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: {3.8,3.9}  ----------------->create environment

steps:
  uses: actions/checkout@v3 ------------------> checkout the code 




*All the plugins are installed to github actions already ,no need to install the plugins separately as jenkins.

Also we can create new self hosted runner if we need more space,security etc. to configure the runner (or pipeline)




-------------------------ADVANTAGES OF GITHUB ACTIONS OVER JENKINS-------------------------------------

##  hosting

jenkins -self hosted
github actions - hosted by github

## user interface

jenkins- complex and sophesticated UI
github actions-streamlined and userfriendly UI


## cost

jenkins- large & complex ----->expensive
github- free for open source projects

use yaml formatter to verify the yaml file
